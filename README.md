# Optimization

This project uses 3 different optimization techniques to find the best one.



## Hill Climbing

Hill Climbing function uses neighboring solutions to find the best solution.

## Simulated Annealing
Simulated Annealing approximates the global optimum.

## Nelder Mead
Nelder Mead finds the minimum of an objective function

## Results
### Test 1: 
Hill Climbing: a =  7  b=  6  fitness=  12
Simulated Annealing: a =  -7  b=  9  fitness=  12
Nelder Mead: a =  1  b=  0  fitness=  12.0

### Test2: 
Hill Climbing: a=  3  b=  2  fitness=  7
Simulated Annealing: a=  1  b=  6  fitness=  7
Nelder Mead: a=  1  b=  0  fitness=  7.0


### Test 3:
Hill Climbing: a=  7  b=  2  fitness=  8
Simulated Annealing: a=  -14  b=  5  fitness=  13
Nelder Mead: a=  1  b=  0  fitness=  8.0



After testing, I believe that the Nelder Mead technique works the best.
